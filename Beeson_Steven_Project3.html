<p>My theme this week is simple. I chose to do a story of three random guys having an 'adventure' in Lansing, MI (My hometown). I chose this to kind of provide an insight to the little amount of stuff we actually have to do here in Lansing. Maybe it is just because I have lived here all my life I may overlook a lot of stuff. Either way, this is my theme and I hope you enjoy. </p>
